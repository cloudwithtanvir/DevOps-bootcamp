### 2. File System

### Understanding Linux File System Hierarchy:

- **Root Directory (`/`):** The base of the Linux file system.
- **Common Directories:**
    - `/bin`: Essential command binaries.
    - `/sbin`: System binaries.
    - `/etc`: Configuration files.
    - `/home`: User home directories.
    - `/var`: Variable files like logs.
    - `/usr`: User binaries and program data.
    - `/tmp`: Temporary files.

### Permissions Management:

- **File Permissions:**
    - **Types:** Read (`r`), Write (`w`), Execute (`x`).
    - **User Classes:** Owner, group, others.
    - **Command:** `chmod` (e.g., `chmod 755 filename`).

### Special Files (/dev, /proc, /sys):

- **/dev:** Device files representing hardware devices.
- **/proc:** Virtual filesystem providing process and system information.
- **/sys:** Interface to kernel data structures.

### 3. Text Editors

### Proficiency with Command-Line Text Editors:

- **Nano:**
    - Easy-to-use text editor.
    - Basic commands: `Ctrl+O` (write out/save), `Ctrl+X` (exit).
- **Vim:**
    - More powerful but complex editor.
    - Modes: Normal, Insert, Visual, Command-line.
    - Basic commands: `i` (insert mode), `:w` (write/save), `:q` (quit).

- **Process Commands:**
    - `ps`: Display current processes.
    - `top`: Display live system processes.
    - `htop`: Enhanced version of `top`.
    - `kill`: Terminate a process by PID.
    - `pkill`: Terminate processes by name.
    - `nice`/`renice`: Change process priority.
- **Background and Foreground Processes:**
    - `&`: Run a command in the background.
    - `fg`: Bring a background process to the foreground.
    - `bg`: Resume a stopped background process.

### 5. Networking

### Basic Networking Commands and Configuration:

- **Network Configuration:**
    - `ifconfig`: Configure a network interface.
    - `ip`: Show/manipulate routing, devices, policy routing, and tunnels.
    - `ping`: Test network connectivity.
    - `netstat`: Display network connections, routing tables, interface statistics.
    - `ss`: Another utility to investigate sockets.
- **Network Management:**
    - `scp`: Secure copy files between hosts.
    - `ssh`: Securely connect to remote machines.
    - `ftp`, `sftp`: Transfer files over network.

### Introduction to Package Managers:

- **Debian-based Systems (e.g., Ubuntu):**
    - `apt-get`, `apt`: Install, update, and remove packages (e.g., `apt-get update`, `apt-get install package_name`).
    - `dpkg`: Install, remove, and provide information about .deb packages.
- **Red Hat-based Systems (e.g., CentOS, Fedora):**
    - `yum`, `dnf`: Install, update, and remove packages (e.g., `yum install package_name`).
    - `rpm`: Install, remove, and provide information about .rpm packages.
- **Common Commands:**
    - `install`: Install a package.
