### Task: Linux Fundamentals Practice

### Objective:

The objective of this task is to reinforce the understanding of essential Linux commands, file system navigation, text editing, process management, networking, and package management covered in Module 2: Linux Fundamentals.

### Task Description:

You will be given a series of practical exercises to complete. These exercises are designed to simulate real-world scenarios encountered in a DevOps environment. Follow the instructions provided for each exercise and use the Linux commands and concepts learned in the module to complete the tasks.

### Exercise 1: File System Navigation and File Management

1. Navigate to the `/var/log` directory.
2. List all files and directories in the `/var/log` directory.
3. Create a new directory named `test_logs` within `/var/log`.
4. Navigate into the `test_logs` directory.
5. Create an empty file named `test.log`.
6. Display the contents of the `test.log` file.
7. Edit the `test.log` file and add a new line of text.
8. Save and exit the text editor.

### Exercise 2: Process Management

1. Display a list of currently running processes.
2. Identify the PID of the process named `nginx` (assuming it's installed and running).
3. Terminate the `nginx` process using its PID.
4. Start the `nginx` process again.

### Exercise 3: Networking

1. Check the network configuration of your system.
2. Test the connectivity to a remote server by pinging its IP address.
3. Use `ssh` to securely connect to a remote machine (replace `remote_user` and `remote_host` with appropriate values).
    
    ```
    ssh remote_user@remote_host
    
    ```
    
4. Transfer a file from your local machine to the remote machine using `scp`.
    
    ```
    scp /path/to/local/file remote_user@remote_host:/path/to/destination
    
    ```
    

### Exercise 4: Package Management

1. Update the package lists on your system.
2. Install the `htop` package using the appropriate package manager for your Linux distribution.
3. Remove the `htop` package from your system.

### Submission:

Once you have completed all the exercises, write a summary of your experience and any challenges you encountered during the task. Include screenshots or logs where necessary to demonstrate your solutions.
